# Machine Learning Engineering & Data Science Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio.  
This repository showcases selected work across machine learning engineering, applied data science, statistical modeling, and exploratory analysis.  
My focus is on building **robust, interpretable, and modular ML systems** that integrate both rigorous modeling and practical engineering.

I approach projects with an emphasis on:

- Clean, maintainable code structures  
- Reproducible experiments  
- Clear analytical reasoning  
- Model interpretability  
- Real-world applicability  

This portfolio includes end-to-end machine learning workflows, advanced modeling techniques, and visualization-driven case studies.

## Professional Focus

I am most passionate about **machine learning engineering**, specifically the intersection of:

- **Model development**
- **Statistical reasoning**
- **Data engineering considerations**
- **Scalable and reproducible ML workflows**  
- **Insight generation and communication**  

I strive to bridge the gap between exploratory data science and production-grade ML, building solutions that are both technically sound and operationally practical.

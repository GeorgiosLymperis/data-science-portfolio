# Car Sales Elasticity Modeling

## Overview
This project analyzes car sales using classical and nonlinear statistical models:
- OLS regression
- Negative Binomial GLM
- Poisson GAM with spline terms
- Price elasticity estimation via numerical differentiation

## Key Questions
- How do price, horsepower, fuel efficiency, and size affect sales volume?
- How does price elasticity vary across market segments?

## Techniques Used
- Statistical modeling (OLS, GLM, GAM)
- EDA and outlier detection
- Residual diagnostics and model validation
- Spline modeling and elasticity interpretation

## Results
- Sales are highly elastic between 30k–50k price range.
- GAM spline effects reveal nonlinear consumer sensitivity.
- Classical models and GAMs produce different elasticity profiles.
